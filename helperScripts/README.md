# Short collection of helpful scripts for dataset creation and/or TTS training stuff

## MRS2LJSpeech
Python script which takes recordings (filesystem and sqlite db) done with Mycroft Mimic-Recording-Studio (https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic-recording-studio) and creates an audio optimized dataset in widely supported LJSpeech directory structure.

Peter Schmalfeldt (https://github.com/manifestinteractive) did an amazing job as he optimized my originally (quick'n dirty) version of that script, so thank you Peter :-)
